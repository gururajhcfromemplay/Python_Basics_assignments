# Python_assignments

Completed the following tasks: 

Part 1: Python Setup
Set up a new virtual environment named "project_env" and activate it.
Install libraries like requests, beautifulsoup4
Deactivate the environment

Part 2: Data Types, Strings, Lists, and Dictionaries
Create a function named data_identifier that accepts a user input. The function should identify and return the data type of the input as 'integer', 'float', 'string', or 'boolean'.
Write a function named string_manipulator that:
Accepts a string as input.
Reverses the string.
Converts every alternate character to uppercase.
Returns the manipulated string.
Given a list of country names, create a dictionary where the key is the country name and the value is the length of the country name. Additionally, sort the dictionary based on the length of the country name.

Part 3: Operators, Loops, and Functions
Implement a function named find_greatest that accepts a list of numbers and uses comparison operators to return the largest number without using any built-in Python functions. Feel free to implement any sorting algo you know.
Write a function named loop_through that accepts a number 'n'. The function should loop from 1 to n and:
Print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
Print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5.
Print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
Otherwise, print the number.

Part 4: OOPS and Classes
Create a class called Rectangle. The class should have:
Attributes: length and width.
A method area that returns the area of the rectangle.
A method perimeter that returns the perimeter.
Create a child class named Square that inherits from Rectangle but only takes a single value for initializing both length and width.

Part 5: Modules, Errors, Decorators, and Generators
Create a module named "utilities". Inside this module, write a function named list_average that returns the average of a list of numbers.
In the main program, handle exceptions to manage possible errors while calculating the average (like if a string is in the list of numbers).
Design a decorator function named execution_time that prints how long a function takes to run.
Create a generator function named fibonacci_gen that yields the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.
